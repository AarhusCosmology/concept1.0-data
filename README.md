## CO*N*CEPT 1.0 data
This repository contains data and scripts used to make all figures found
within the paper
‘[The cosmological simulation code CO*N*CEPT 1.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01508)’,
which is the primary code paper for the
[CO*N*CEPT code](https://github.com/jmd-dk/concept).



### Generating figures
The figures (already present in the `figures` directory) can be regenerated by
running
```bash
PYTHON=/path/to/python make
```
where `/path/to/python` is the path to the Python interpreter to use.

This will fist parse and process the raw data files and store the results in a
[pickled](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) format in a `.pickle`
directory (if generating the figures once more, this pickled data will be used
directly). The various figures are then created from the processed data by
calling the various `.py` files within the `script` directory. Each such
`.py` file is responsible for a separate figure (13 in total), the exception
being `helper.py` which instead provides functionality common to the other
`.py` files.


#### Cleanup
- The generated figures can be removed via
  ```bash
  make clean-figure
  ```
- The pickled data can be removed via
  ```bash
  make clean-pickle
  ```
- The figures as well as the pickled data can be removed simultaneously via
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```


#### Required libraries and tools
The figure generation requires the following libraries and tools to be
installed on the system. The version numbers given are known to work,
though many other versions will work as well.
- Python 3.8.5
  - NumPy 1.19.2
  - SciPy 1.5.2
  - Matplotlib 3.3.2
  - Class 2.7.2
- Ghostscript 9.50 (Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ghostscript`)
- pdfcrop 1.38     (Ubuntu: `sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils`)
- pdfinfo 0.86.1   (Ubuntu: `sudo apt install poppler-utils`)
- GNU grep 3.4
- GNU coreutils 8.30

The above versions of Python itself and Python packages coincide with the
versions shipping with CO*N*CEPT 1.0.1, so you may use this Python to build
the figures.



### The data
The raw data (situated within the `data` directory) consists of
- CO*N*CEPT power spectra data files
- CO*N*CEPT log files
- Memory dumps.
  - These are generated via the `mem` script, which is not needed to generate
    the figures, but which nontheless is included in the `script` directory
    for completeness.
- The file `t_a.dat` mapping cosmic times (in Gyr) and scale factor values to
  each other, in the radiation-less cosmology `H0 = 67*km/(s*Mpc)`,
  `Ωb = 0.049`, `Ωcdm = 0.27`, used for all simulations.
